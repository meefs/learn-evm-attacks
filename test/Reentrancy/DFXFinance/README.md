## Step-by-step

1. Request a Flashloan
2. Deposit the received amount in the loan callback

## Detailed Description

As there is no reentrancy protection in the flashloan function and token balances are checked to determine if the loan was paid back, the attacker simply asked for a loan and deposited the amount requested to mint shares inside the loan callback.

```solidity
    function flash(
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external transactable noDelegateCall isNotEmergency {
        ...
        ...
        uint256 balance0After = IERC20(derivatives[0]).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balance1After = IERC20(derivatives[1]).balanceOf(address(this));

        require(balance0Before.add(fee0) <= balance0After, 'Curve/insufficient-token0-returned');
        require(balance1Before.add(fee1) <= balance1After, 'Curve/insufficient-token1-returned');
    }
```

Because the balance checked after executing the flashloan callback was satisfied, the loan succeded. Then, the attacker simply called withdraw and stole the loan amount.

## Possible mitigations

- Use reentrancy protection for flashloans
- Check if the flashloan key checks could be manipuladed by side-entering the contract and if so, evaluate its impact. Whenever a risk arises, add a reentrancy mutex to the vulnerable functions and to the flashLoan itself.
