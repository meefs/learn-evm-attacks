## Step-by-step

1. Get whitelisted
2. Call the whitelist mint function with a high number of `chosenAmount` so you mint all available NFTs.

## Detailed Description

The attacker claimed 400 NFTs in a single transaction. The mistake is in the `WhiteListMint` function, where anyone whitelisted can pass an arbitrary `chosenAmount`. The `_numberMinted_` map is only updated after calling the function, so the `require` passes for any number on the first try.

```solidity
    function WhiteListMint(bytes32[] calldata _merkleProof, uint256 chosenAmount)
        public
    {
        require(_numberMinted(msg.sender)<1, "Already Claimed");
        require(isPaused == false, "turn on minting");
        require(
            chosenAmount > 0,
            "Number Of Tokens Can Not Be Less Than Or Equal To 0"
        );
        require(
            totalSupply() + chosenAmount <= maxsupply - reserve,
            "all tokens have been minted"
        );
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender));
        require(
            MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof, rootHash, leaf),
            "Invalid Proof"
        );
        _safeMint(msg.sender, chosenAmount);
    }


```

## Possible mitigations

- The `chosenAmount` parameter seems to be useless and would better be a constant of `1` if that was the intended usage.
- Otherwise, if it was intended to allow for more than one mint per accoutn, restrict the `chosenAmount` parameter.
