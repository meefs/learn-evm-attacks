## Step-by-step

1. Craft and deploy a contract so that it passes the requirements.
2. Call `redeem` with the malicious contract as the `token_`

## Detailed Description

The attack relies on an arbitrarily supplied `token_` parameter. The attacker simply needs to construct a malicious contract as the `token_`. Most importantly, it should return a token that has been permitted by the victim contract to move funds when its `_underlying()` method is called.

```solidity
    function redeem(ERC20BondToken token_, uint256 amount_)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant {
        if (uint48(block.timestamp) < token_.expiry())
            revert Teller_TokenNotMatured(token_.expiry());
        token_.burn(msg.sender, amount_);
        token_.underlying().transfer(msg.sender, amount_);
    }
```

The attacker chose to set `_underlying()` to the OHM address.

Luckily for the DAO, the attacker was a whitehack that later returned the funds.

## Possible mitigations

- Implement a whitelist of allowed tokens.
