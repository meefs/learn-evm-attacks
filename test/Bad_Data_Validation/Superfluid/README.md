## Step-by-step

1. Craft a `Context` with a forged `msg.sender`
2. Get it authorized via the host contract

## Detailed Description

This attack relies on a problem in the serialization of the `ctx` in the `Host` contract. To understand this, we need to know that `Superfluid.sol` allows composing `agreements` from different `Super Apps` in a single transaction.

To mantain a state throught the different calls to different `Supper Apps`, this `ctx` is set by the `Host` contract.

Nevertheless, it was possible for the attacker to construct an initial `ctx` that impersonated any user.

The problem can be seen in the [updateSubscription method](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/d04426e7d6950ae9a27d0c50debb7aab7cac1925/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L466), which uses the `AgreementLibrary` to `authorizeTokenAccess`.

Unfortunately, this method [does not authorize much](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/d04426e7d6950ae9a27d0c50debb7aab7cac1925/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/AgreementLibrary.sol#L39) besides requiring that the call comes from a particular address.

The attacker can now send a crafted message that set's anyone as the [`publisher`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/d04426e7d6950ae9a27d0c50debb7aab7cac1925/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L483).

## Possible mitigations

- The [`git blame`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blame/48f5951c1fb30127a462cce7b16871c435d66e10/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/AgreementLibrary.sol#L43) of this fix is quite straightforward: the `authorizeTokenAccess` has to actually call the `Host` to make sure this context has been aproved by it.
