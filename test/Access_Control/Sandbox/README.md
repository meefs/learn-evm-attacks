## Step-by-step

1. Find a player you don't like
2. Call `_burn` with `(enemyAddress, enemyAddress, id)`
3. You have destroyed your enemy NFT

## Detailed Description

The Sandbox Land contract has a `_burn` method that destroys an NFT.

```solidity
    function _burn(address from, address owner, uint256 id) public {
        require(from == owner, "not owner");
        _owners[id] = 2**160; // cannot mint it again
        _numNFTPerAddress[from]--;
        emit Transfer(from, address(0), id);
    }
```

The method apparently intends to authenticate the `burn`, but does so using
parameters to the function instead of `msg.sender`. This leads to the attack being
quite trivial: the attacker just sends `from == owner`.

## Possible mitigations

- Use `msg.sender` instead of the function parameter `from`
