## Step-by-step

1. Create a contract that does not revert when receiving a call to `migrateWithdraw`
2. Call `migrateStake(evilContract, MAX_UINT256)` and get a lot of tokens.

## Detailed Description

The protocol wanted to allow users to migrate stake from an old contract to a new one. To do that, they provided a `migrateStake` function:

```solidity
    function migrateStake(address oldStaking, uint256 amount) external {
        StaxLPStaking(oldStaking).migrateWithdraw(msg.sender, amount);
        _applyStake(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

An OK implementation of `migrateWithdraw` should transfer `amount` from `msg.sender` to the current contract and revert if it wasn't able to. `_applyStake` would later add `amount` to `msg.sender`.

Unfortunately, it is trivial to pass an evil `oldStaking` contract that never reverts.

## Possible mitigations

- Store a list of valid `oldStaking` contract addresses and whitelist them (needs an `owner` if the list needs to be dynamic)
